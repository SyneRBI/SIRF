This directory contains examples and demos on how to use SIRF. 
Please also see the [related Wiki page](https://github.com/CCPPETMR/SIRF/wiki/Examples).

Most of the demos use simplistic data for illustration. The images might therefore be
not very interesting either. The idea here is to illustrate what you can do with SIRF,
not to give you a polished script that you would want to use on a daily basis.

The demos display usually some images. Generally, these might not make too much sense
unless you have a look at the code.
