This folder contains simple scripts demonstrating the use of SIRF for
PETMR related tasks. There are examples on synergistic image reconstruction
in  our Jupyter notebooks in the [SIRF Exercises](https://github.com/SyneRBI/SIRF-Exercises/#readme).

See the [Python/README](../README.md) for instructions.
