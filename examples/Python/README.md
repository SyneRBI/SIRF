This folder's subfolders contains Python demo scripts.

For a brief description of each script's purpose and usage type
```sh
python <script_name>.py --help
```
(on the VM use `python3` instead of `python`).

Note that the SIRF Python utilities should be in your `PYTHONPATH` (see the installation instructions).

See [the main README section](../README.md#environment-variables) for information
on environment variables.
If you do not set the environment variables that allow SIRF to find the example data,
you can still run most demos but you will have to give full path to raw data files via command-line options `-p` or `--path`.
