# Demonstration of basic PET capabilities with SIRF: 
# basic OSEM reconstruction, projection with a (slightly) more sophisticated acquisition model
##
# This demo is a 'script', i.e. intended to be run step by step in a 
# Python IDE such as spyder. It is organised in 'cells'. spyder displays these
# cells nicely and allows you to run each cell on its own.
#
# WARNING: This script assumes you have run the display_and_projection.py demo first!

#%% We now add a multiplicative term to the acquisition model
# In PET, detector-pairs have different efficiencies. We want to include
# this in our 'forward' model such that the reconstruction can
# take this into account.
#
# The way to do this in SIRF is to include 'bin efficiencies' in the model,
# i.e. one multiplicative factor for each bin in the data.
#
# You would normally derive these efficiencies from a "normalisation" scan.
# Here we will simply set the efficiencies for some 'views' to zero.
# This is actually physically impossible for PET (although ok for SPECT),
# but this is only a demo!
