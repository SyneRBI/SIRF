This folder contains scripts demonstrating the use of SIRF for SPECT reconstruction and related tasks.

All scripts currently use STIR as the reconstruction engine but actually allow the use of any reconstruction engine that provides the necessary functionality such as `AcquisitionData` object, `make_Poisson_loglikelihood` function etc.

See the [Python/README](../README.md) for instructions.
