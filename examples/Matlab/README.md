This folder's subfolders contain Matlab demo scripts for PET and MR reconstruction.

Unfortunately, we no longer support Matlab, so have not checked in a while if these
demos work. Apologies.

See [the main README section](../README.md#environment-variables) for information
on environment variables.

The folder YOUR_PATH/build/install/bin (see SIRF/INSTALL.txt) must be in the Windows path,
and the folder YOUR_PATH/build/install/matlab in Matlab path.

To use Matlab doc feature on demo scripts, you also need to add folders 
YOUR_PATH/SIRF/examples/Matlab/MR and YOUR_PATH/SIRF/examples/Matlab/PET and their 
sub-folders to the Matlab path.
