/*! \namespace sirf
  \brief Namespace for the SIRF library (and some/most of its applications)

  This namespace encompasses the whole
  library. All classes, functions and symbols are in this namespace.
  This has the effect that conflicts with any other library is
  impossible (except if that library uses the same namespace...).
