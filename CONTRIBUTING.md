Contributing
============

Please help us by finding problems, discussing on the mailing lists, contributing documentation,
bug fixes or even features. Below are some brief guidelines.

## Reporting a problem

Please use our [issue-tracker]: https://github.com/CCPPETMR/SIRF/issues

## Submitting a patch

For contributing any code or documentation that is non-trivial, we require a
signed Contributor License Agreement, stating clearly that your
conributions are licensed appropriately. This will normally need to be signed by your
employer/university, unless you own your own copyright.
You will have to do this only once. Please contact us for more information.

Please keep a patch focused on a single issue/feature. This is important to keep our history clean,
but will also help reviewing things and therefore speed-up acceptance.

### Process

This is our recommended process. If it sounds too daunting, ask for help.

1. Create a new issue (see above). State that you will contribute a fix if you intend to do so.
2. Create a [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) on github and work from there.
3. Create a branch in your fork with a descriptive name and put your fixes there. If your fix is
simple you could do it on github by editing a file, otherwise clone your project (or add a remote
to your current git clone) and work as usual.
4. If your change is important, add it to [CHANGES.md](https://github.com/CCPPETMR/SIRF/blob/master/CHANGES.md)
and even [UserGuide.md](https://github.com/CCPPETMR/SIRF/blob/master/doc/UserGuide.md) or other documentation files.
5. Use [well-formed commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
for each change (in particular with a single "subject" line
followed by an empty line and then more details).
6. Push the commits to your fork and submit a [pull request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
(enable changes by project admins.) Be prepared to add further commits to your branch after discussion.
In the description of the PR, add a statement about which Issue this applies to
using [a phrase such that github auto-closes the issue when merged to master](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/).
7. After acceptance of your PR, go home with a nice warm feeling.

### A note on copyright dates and notices (and licenses)

(Almost) all SIRF files start with a copyright and license header. Please do this for your files as well.
If you modify an existing file, you need to make sure the copyright header is up-to-date for your changes
(unless it's a trivial change).

If you copied code from somewhere, you need to preserve its copyright date/notice. If you copied non-SIRF code,
you need to make sure its license is compatible with the SIRF license, and indicate clearly what the license
of the copied code is (and follow its terms of course).

In addition, you might need to add yourself to [NOTICE.txt](https://github.com/CCPPETMR/SIRF/blob/master/NOTICE.txt).

## Project rules

- Only one official, stable, up-to-date branch: **master**
    + Essentially "latest stable beta version with no known bugs
      since the last official release version"
    + Never knowingly add a bug to **master**
- Any work-in-progress commits should be in their own branches.
- GitHub assigns a unique number to each issue, c.f. the [issue-tracker].
- A pull request (PR) is an issue with an associated branch,
  c.f. [pull-requests]. Even for "internal" development, we prefer a PR for
  a branch to allow review and discussion.
- Branches and PRs are kept small (ideally one 'feature' only) and branch from **master**,
  not from another branch, unless required. This allows
  commenting/improving/merging this branch/PR
  independent of other developments.
- Discussions on issues and PRs are forwarded to the
  <CCP-PETMR-DEVEL@jiscmail.ac.uk> mailing list daily.
    + Forwarded from github via the [googlegroup],
      which is also a backup in case github dies.
- Contributions of new features should also update documentation and release notes. After version 1.0,
  this needs documentation needs to state something like "introduced after version 1.xxx".
- We prefer issues to be opened via [github][issue-tracker] due to the following reasons:
    + Ensures issues will never get lost in emails
        * Facilitates issue status tracking
    + Allows focused comments/discussion
        * Easy cross-referencing of related issues, PRs, and commits
    + The mailing list gets notified within 24 hours.

## Submodules

> [...] A submodule is a repository embedded inside another repository. The
> submodule has its own history [...]

This project uses [submodules] to point to infrequently changed/large datasets.

1. How to pull updates to SIRF
```bash
# first time
SIRF$ git clone https://github.com/CCPPETMR/SIRF --recursive
# subsequently
SIRF$ git pull
SIRF$ git submodule update --init --recursive
# or
SIRF$ git pull --recurse-submodules
```
2. How to push updates to the data submodule in SIRF
```bash
SIRF$ cd data
SIRF/data$ # create/change some files
SIRF/data$ git commit -m "add some data" && git push && cd ..
SIRF$ git add --force data  # force required for safety (see 4 below)
SIRF$ git commit -m "update submodule" && git push
```
3. What happens when switching branches
    + When switching branches in SIRF, the data submodule will not be touched.
      `git submodule update` needs to be manually run in order to ensure the
      correct submodule commit is also checked out
	+ WARNING: This is why `git add --all` is bad practice (if you forget to
	  update submodules when needed, then committing all modifications will
	  include the current wrong submodule commit)
4. What happens if upstream changes conflict
    + The `data` submodule may be force-pushed to by maintainers
      to reduce its size (removing unneeded data from git history).
      Consequentially `SIRF$ git status` may indicate changes in the `data`
      submodule despite a user not having touched it.
      In order to overwrite the local outdated submodule:
```bash
SIRF$ cd data
SIRF/data$ git fetch origin && git reset --hard origin/master && cd ..
```
